# subimagecheck
A simple demonstration of detecting whether a cropped image exists in another. When one of the images is a confirmed subimage crop of the other, the top and left offset is displayed. If nothing is found, nothing is displayed.

### Usage:
Run `npx subimagecheck <first_image_path> <second_image_path>`.
